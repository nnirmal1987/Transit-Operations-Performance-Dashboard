Service Reliability %

Primary Delay Code (calculated per trip)

⚙ Technical Implementation

Power BI

Data modeling (Trip-level aggregation)

DAX for primary delay code logic

Pareto analysis using cumulative % measures

KPI calculations

🔎 Key Insights

Top 3 delay codes contribute to ~60% of delayed trips

Peak erosion observed in late summer months

High concentration of delays in select urban hubs
