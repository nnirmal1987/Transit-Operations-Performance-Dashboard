🚆 Transit Operations Performance Dashboard
📌 Overview

This project analyzes transit service reliability using simulated trip and delay event data.

📊 Business Problem

Identify major drivers of service delays and evaluate monthly on-time performance trends.

🧠 Key Metrics

Total Trips

Delayed Trips (≥5 min threshold)

Service Reliability %

Primary Delay Code (calculated per trip)

⚙ Technical Implementation

Power BI

Data modeling (Trip-level aggregation)

DAX for primary delay code logic

Pareto analysis using cumulative % measures

KPI calculations

🔎 Key Insights

Top 3 delay codes contribute to ~60% of delayed trips

Peak erosion observed in late summer months

High concentration of delays in select urban hubs
